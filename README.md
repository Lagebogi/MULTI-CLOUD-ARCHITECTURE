*DESCIRPTION* : In this assignment, I opened AWS and Azure consoles. Launched an EC2 instance in Ubuntu with all http https and SSH open. I connected to the instance and was logged in as a root user. Then, I switched to Azure and added a server using Azure ARC. Generated a script that should be executed in an AWS EC2 instance. Ran the script in the instance, Authenticated it then Azure was successfully connected to the machine agent. Ec2 instance showed that the connection was established. The server was shown in the Azure RG1 resource group having the same IP as the AWS Ec2 instance.
